## Description:
Life moves fast, why waste time on books you won't enjoy? Bookmarked allows the user to add books to three lists; Currently Reading, Have Read, and Want to read. Each list allows the user to add and remove so they can keep track of their books. Search a book by your favorite author, or find something new.  Bookmarked also allows the user to interact with friends and see what they're reading. Take a break and save your place at the newest site to find your next best read.
